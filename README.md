# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch for the Odin Project.

## EDIT - June 26 - 2023
Very simple design for the Etch-a-Sketch project from TOP, I wanted something simple but functional.
I initially wanted to make something more "complex" looking but, I realized it would've been time consuming and not very productive as of now.
